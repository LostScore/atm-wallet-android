The app uses an exchange rate to show you an estimate of how much your cryptocurrencies are worth in your local currency. When you send a transaction and enter the amount to send in your local currency, the app uses the exchange rate to calculate how much cryptocurrency to send.</p>\n<p>It's possible people using other wallets are using different exchange rates, so the balance sent/received might be slight different than what other person sees.</p>\n<p>Since the exchange rate is always changing, the amount of money in your wallet as quoted in your local currency may change over time. However, your cryptocurrency balances will not change unless you send or receive these.</p>"},{"id":360004905674,"url":"https://bwsupport.zendesk.com/api/v2/help_center/en-us/articles/360004905674-How-do-I-wipe-my-wallet-.json","html_url":"https://bwsupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004905674-How-do-I-wipe-my-wallet-","author_id":116533177513,"comments_disabled":true,"draft":false,"promoted":false,"position":0,"vote_sum":0,"vote_count":0,"section_id":360001029193,"created_at":"2018-05-24T03:58:50Z","updated_at":"2019-05-03T05:08:57Z","name":"How do I wipe my wallet?","title":"How do I wipe my wallet?","source_locale":"en-us","locale":"en-us","outdated":false,"outdated_locales":[],"edited_at":"2019-05-03T05:08:57Z","user_segment_id":null,"permission_group_id":1615254,"label_names":["slug:wipe-wallet"],"body":"<p>The BRD app can only have one wallet active at a time.
